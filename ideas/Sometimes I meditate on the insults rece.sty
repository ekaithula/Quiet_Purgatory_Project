Sometimes I meditate on the insults received from those who I love, repeatedly. In depression, I was told to take my demons away. After a lot of pain and darkness, I realized that just maybe, just maybe, I was a demon. Now I set out to know myself. Guaranteed, and you are a good person, and someone who knew me literally for decades asked me to take my demons away from her.

This demon has a virtue called unconditional love. Unconditional love is very, very complex because it means loving those who hate you or hurt you — like the Bible says. Not from the Bible, but selfish self-sacrifice. I believe in unconditional love to those I love with no limit. Logical or not, I’m okay with being called crazy — self-sacrifice to love unconditionally.

This is one spot that’s made several events devastate the two people I loved completely and unconditionally — my wife and daughter. Calling betrayal would be selfish and not go through because of my expectations without validating they would do the same.

The day I was released from jail after domestic violence, I had no way to get home, and the only phone call I received was from my heart and soul — my daughter. I made it home through a strange kindness. I went and sat myself in a room upstairs. The next situation was the implication that I should not be in my house because of the charges brought against me.

Again, to understand other people’s limits, I love. There were other nuances that salted the wound that I found out later — like my friend coming to visit on the night when I was in jail.

A previous time, me and her had an altercation mid-flight a bit, and she bit my lip, almost severed a nerve. When I got back to the United States, she bought me a bunch of straws and napkins, which I appreciated when I drooled. My way of making light of it is that the pain was actually a turn-on.

Again, my fault — my assumption was that I would receive even a ride though, so fuck it. It’s better to have loved and lost. Do not treat people how you would like to be treated — treat them how they want to be treated.

But I’ve not given up. Through the pain, I’m beginning Chapter 2 of my life. The biggest advisor, cheerleader, angel from above has been a daughter who I do not deserve. Years before I started fucking up, she told me that I would need to switch gears from who I was to somebody else, because life was changing in very big ways, and I needed to embrace it.

At such a tender age, she is the one raising me. When I said, seeking and feeling sobriety after just a few days of being dry, she called me and said, “I am proud of you.” It was simple, kind, and sincere — from someone who is the reason I continue being on this planet. I had to get off the phone because I was weeping like someone feeding crocodile tears.
